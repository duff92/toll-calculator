# Toll Calculator

A React application for calculating and managing toll fees, built with TypeScript, Material UI, and Redux. This is only a mock application based on the original task defined in [Toll Calculator](https://github.com/IvyTechSE/toll-calculator)

## Overview

The Toll Calculator helps users track and calculate toll passages for different vehicles. It implements a comprehensive toll fee system with rules for different vehicle types, time periods, and daily maximums.

### Key Features

- Calculate toll fees based on vehicle type and time of passage
- Track toll passages for registered vehicles
- View detailed passage history with daily summaries
- Apply special rules for toll-free vehicles and dates
- Responsive design with accessibility

## Toll Fee Rules

The application implements the following toll fee rules:

- Fees differ between 8 SEK and 18 SEK, depending on the time of day
- Rush-hour traffic has the highest fee
- Maximum fee for one day is 60 SEK
- A vehicle is only charged once per hour (highest fee applies)
- Some vehicle types are toll-free (Emergency, Diplomat, Military, Foreign)
- Weekends and holidays are toll-free
- July is toll-free

## Key Components

- **MainLayout**: Main application layout with navigation
- **PassagesList**: Displays toll passages with filtering options
- **VehicleInformation**: Shows details about a vehicle
- **RegNumberInput**: Input for vehicle registration numbers
- **Sidebar**: Navigation sidebar

## API Endpoints

The application uses a mocked API with MSW. The main endpoints are:

- **GET /api/vehicles**
  Returns a list of all vehicles.

- **GET /api/vehicles/:registrationNumber**
  Retrieves details of a vehicle by its registration number.

- **GET /api/passages/:vehicleId**
  Returns toll passage history for the specified vehicle.

- **GET /api/passages?date=YYYY-MM-DD&numberOfDays=N&vehicleId=xxx**
  Returns filtered passages grouped by date along with a daily fee summary.
  • `date`: Start date for filtering.
  • `numberOfDays`: Duration (in days) for filtering.
  • `vehicleId`: (Optional) Filter by a specific vehicle.

- **POST /api/calculate-toll**
  Calculates the toll fee for a given vehicle type and timestamp.
  Request body includes `vehicleType` and `timestamp`.

- **POST /api/passages**
  Records a new toll passage.
  Request body includes `vehicleType`, `timestamp`, and `location`.

## Accessibility

The application follows WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines with:

- Proper heading hierarchy
- ARIA attributes
- Skip link
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility

## Upcoming wishlist

- Add a sign in page using BankID to make users login
- Fetch your vehicle information based on your social security number and combine that with e.g. https://biluppgifter.se/
- List all your Vehicles under a vehicle page and then maybe remove the search field since it will be redundant
- Add a settings page for user information and preferences
- Additional unit tests for ALL components
- Additional e2e tests for all pages with a11y checks after interacting with the application
